- Unit Test for each possible path of execution to get 100% code coverage
- Array / Lists to be updated to IEnumerable
- caching can be done inside ParsedWordsImpl to save some CPU cycle
- SingleLineProcessor could expose a static API for processing
- Word constants could be read from a config file, instead of an array, Set can be used
- Alias Manager / Commodity Manager could potentially implement an interface to facilitate Unit Testing
- Logging could have been leveraged
- Corner cases for language processing eg. no space between last word and '?'
- Leverage constituency-based parse tree or Dependency-based parse tree for language processing
- Dependency injection via constructor (rather than public properties)
